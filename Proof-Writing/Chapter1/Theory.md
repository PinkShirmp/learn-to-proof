# Sets
*  All mathematics can be described with set 
*  A set that have infinite element called **infinity set**. Otherwise, A set that have limited elements called **finite set**
*  Given set A and B,  two set are equal if they have same element: 
$${\forall i \land A_i=B_{i}} $$
And Also:
$$\emptyset \ne  \{\emptyset\}$$
### Set builder notation
Given a set X the format of the set builder notion is:
$$X=\{expression:rule\}$$
##### Note:
The expression $|X|$ means absolute value of X if X is a number and size if $X$ is a set
**For example**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
B=\{x \in Z : |X|<3\} \\
Therefore: B=\{\{1,2\},\{7\}\}
\end{aligned}
$$

### The Cartesian product
The Cartesian product of two sets A and B is another set, denoted as A × B and defined as $$A * B=\{(a,b):a\in A,b \in B\}$$

If A,B is a finite set, then |A x B|= |A|.|B|
### Subsets
$A,B$ are set.If element in $A$ also an element of $B$, then we say $A$ is a **subset** of $B$  , and we denote this as $A \subset B$

### Power Set

If $A$ is a set, the **power set** of $A$ is another set, denoted as $P(A)$ and defined to be the set of all subsets of A.$$P(A)=\{X:X\in A\}$$
If A is a finite set then $|P(A)=2^|A||$

### Complement
$$P \in N$$
if N is the universal set(N is a larger set) of P

Let A be a set with a universal set U. The complement of A, denoted A, is the set A = U − A
